        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bred to be a companion, the Shih Tzu is an affectionate, happy, outgoing toy dog breed, weighing 10 - 19 pounds when fully grown.</p>
        <p>They have short muzzles, large dark eyes, soft and long double coats, drop ears, and heavily furred tails. Their coats may be of any color though white with grey or brown are common. A very noticeable feature is the underbite.</p>
        <p>Although a Shih Tzu's temperament varies, the breed has a personality and temperament that is loyal, affectionate, outgoing, and alert. Training and proper socializing must start at a young age for them to obey basic commands because they are prone to stubbornness in training. Due to their friendly nature, they tend to interact well with other dogs, children, and adults. They make excellent house pets in an apartment or a place without a large garden as they require minimal exercise.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Shih Tzu is also known as the chrysanthemum dog or little lion. The exact origins of the breed are unknown, but it is thought to have originated in Tibet and then been developed in China. The dogs were favorites of the Chinese royals and so prized that the Chinese refused to sell, trade, or give any away for several years.</p>
        <p>In 1928, the first Shih Tzus, a male and female pair, were brought to England from Peking by Lady Brownrigg, the wife of the quartermaster general of the north China command. In 1933, a Mrs. Hutchins brought a Shih Tzu from China to Ireland; this dog was eventually bred to Lady Brownrigg's. These three dogs formed the foundation of Lady Brownrigg's kennel. The breed spread throughout Europe in the early 1930s and then was brought to the United States after World War II. Members of the U.S. military brought the dogs back from Europe in the mid-1950s.</p>
