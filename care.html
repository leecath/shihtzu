    <h1>Caring For Your Pup</h1>
    
    <div class="care">
        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>Smaller breeds of dogs are more easily injured. Shih Tzus are not delicate because they have strong muscles, but things like falling, being stepped on, or bothered by other, bigger dogs can be serious situations for a small dog.</p>
        <p>Another thing to note is that they are very sensitive to hot weather. Bring your dog inside during the summer or make sure you give him lots of shade and cool water. Keep an eye on your dog when there are long stretches of hot days.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="care">
        <h2>Home</h2>
        <!--type of home-->
        <p>Because Shih Tzus are small and great lap dogs, they make great pets for condos and apartments and like to live in both the city and country.They are also very friendly and social, getting along with children and other dogs.</p>
        <!--housebreaking-->
        <p>Some dogs are a little difficult to housebreak, but they are smart and will learn with kindness, patience, and persistence. It is a good idea however, to take them out for walks at least once a day. They do not need a lot of exercise, but they are lively and it is good for their muscle and heart health.</p>

        <h2>Grooming</h2>
        <p>Shih Tzus' coats have 2 layers: the beautiful, luxurious hair that sheds, and a hidden undercoat. They need to be brushed or combed daily, or the hair will become tangled and matted. Spend a lot of time with them at an early age so they become comfortable. Roll them over, touch their feet, look at their teeth, and brush them gently to help get them used to being handled when they are older.</p>
        <p>They have a lot of hair around their face, so many people keep it tied up out of their eyes. They often need the corners of their eyes cleaned with a cloth to keep mucous from building up. Their faces also frequently gets dirty when they eat or drink because their noses are short and their faces are close to the food. Have a towel handy to wipe them clean.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="care">
        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>Shih Tzus must be treated carefully and gently. Rough play with a puppy or even a full grown dog can be harmful.It is important to teach dogs to respect owners. They are sociable animals who like to live with other sociable animals in a group or pack. This "pack instinct" is built into their genes. Their instincts compel them to seek out structure - who are the leaders, and who are the followers? Whoever is allowed to set the rules and make decisions are the leaders, and the rest are followers. If an order is not established, dogs may try to assume that role themselves because their instincts tell them that a pack needs a leader.</p>
        <p>Boredom and frustration are the root of many behavior problems as well. Make sure that they are getting plenty of attention and exercise. They are sociable creatures, so this could prevent venting in the forms of digging, destroying things, rambunctiouness, barking, etc.</p>

        <h2>Laws</h2>
        <p>Link: <a href="http://www.animallaw.com/laws.cfm">Animal Resource Law Center</a></p>
        <p>In all reality, the number and breadth of dog laws reflects more of an emphasis on protecting people and property from harm. Dogs, like any other form of property in the legal system, may be regulated to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people. Local dog laws (ordinances) involve a variety of subjects including licensing, vaccination, leash laws, the number of dogs a person may keep, and procedures for impounding dogs.</p>
        <p>Local ordinances and state laws attempt to strike a balance between protecting people and respecting owners' rights. There even seems to be a greater movement by the courts in recognizing the rights of owners. Citizens can become involved to ensure that local governments create ordinances that attempt to meet the needs of all its citizens, human and animal.</p>

        <h2>Traveling</h2>
        <p><span style= "font-weight:bold";>Cars: </span>Car sickness is often caused because the inner ears sense movement but the dog does not see movement (he is not moving in relation to the inside of the car).</p>

        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p>Shih Tzus are athletic with strong muscles, so they love to play. It doesn't take much coaxing to get them interested in doing fun things. They enjoy games, playing ball and doing tricks. It is a good idea to keep them busy because they have a lot of energy.</p>
        <p>They will love dog parks, the beach, city streets, hiking paths and more, but always keep the environment in mind and prepare accordingly. Be sure to supervise, neuter, vaccinate, exercise flea and tick prevention as needed.</p>
